far future:
make slab allocator

have max order be dynamically updated depending on free memory

better memory zone handling than just global alloc function

make map_kernel method which uses big pages


current:

make sure not to rely on exported headers

use protection keys, might be less jank

inmprove build system, rebuild resource file when needed and don't link when not needed, and allow setting compiler variable

put stack protection pages at end

put locks were needed
